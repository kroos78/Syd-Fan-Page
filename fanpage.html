    Sydney Lorena Bennett (born April 23, 1992), known professionally as Syd (formerly Syd tha Kyd), is an American singer and songwriter of escapist, sensual soul from Los Angeles, California. Her voice is languid but enthused, peppered with warm laughter and thoughtful pauses. She is the founding member of the band The Internet, and was a member of the alternative hip hop collective Odd Future. Bennett released her 2017 debut solo album Fin, followed by the EP Always Never Home.

    Her debut album, 2017’s Fin, was lauded as one of the best R&B sets of that year (the Guardian described it as “astonishingly accomplished”). This is of no surprise for she is incredibly talented. She learned to play paino at age four. She then learned drums and taught herself guitar on her mum’s old nylon-string, ending up at the local Hamilton music academy during high school. This is when she became excited with sound engineering and built her own studio at age 14 and how she met Odd Future.

    The reality is that Syd’s music – both with the Internet and as a solo artist – often serves as an escape from the bad stuff. On Fin she luxuriates in sex and sensuality. She takes you on a fantastic journey and I hope that others will come to appreciate her as much as I do.
